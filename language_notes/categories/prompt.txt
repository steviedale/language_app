I'm creating a language learning app (learning Italian for English speakers). It is going to be a general tool that allows beginners to learn simple words.  I will be creating different categories and sub categories. For example noun/places, noun/people, noun/animals, verb/shopping, verb/cooking, etc. I will be asking you to create csv files for each category/sub category. For each csv file I would like the following columns:  
- the category 
- the sub category 
- the word/phrase in english 
- a short definition of the word in English (in case the word is vague or ambiguous) 
- the word/phrase in Italian 
- Italian pronunciation
- singular_plural: whether the word is plural or singular or not applicable 
- tense: whether the word is past tense, present tense, not applicable, etc 
- gender: whether the word is masculine, feminine, or not applicable 
- commonness a number between 1 and 3 which indicates how common the word is. 
- part_of_speech
- formal_informal
- example_sentence_en
- example_sentence_it
- related_words_it
- article_type

When we come across a word that has multiple possible tenses, singular/plural, masculine feminine, or other version, please provide each possible form of the word. Also for nouns, please include a version with "the" and a version with "a/an" (I think this will only be applicable for singular versions). Each version of the word will have it's own row. There will be duplicate definitions and other values, but that's okay.

Clarifications:
1. mark n/a where ever something is not applicable to that word
2. use additional parts of speech
3. please include all forms of common conjugations. Each form of a word should be its own row. Yes include infinitives.
4. use phonetic pronunciation
5. related words should be synonyms, only a 1 to 3 synonyms
6. let's keep the example sentences pretty basic. Let's try to make the sentences as applicable as possible to something a person visiting Italy.
7. each example sentence should be different. Please make sure the word used in the italian sentence is the same Italian word from that row.
8. file name should be <category>_<sub_category>.csv.

Let's start by creating a csv file for noun places. Please provide approximately 100 different types of words. Since we will be including a row for every form of the word, that means there will be several hundred rows total.
